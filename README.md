<h1>Contact List ðŸ“±</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The application is a contact management system that I created using C#. A list of contacts, each with a name and phone number, can be created, managed, and stored by users. Users have the ability to list all stored contacts, search for contacts, add new contacts, and delete old ones. To ensure data persistence across sessions, the application employs JSON serialisation to save the contact list to a file and load it back. It is adaptable to various user preferences thanks to its interactive menu for easy control and support for command-line arguments for complex actionsðŸ˜„
